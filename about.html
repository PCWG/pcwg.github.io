<h2>Power Curve Working Group</h2>
<p>The PCWG mission is <b><i>to bring together wind industry stakeholders to help identify and develop ways to improve the modelling of turbine performance in real world wind conditions.</i></b>
<p>The PCWG is now in its sixth year and has a membership of over 350 people drawn from over 140 organisations. </p>

<h2>Intelligence Sharing Initiative</h2>
<p>
The goals of the PCWG Intelligence Sharing Initiative (PCWG-Share-X) are as follows:
<ul>
<li>To objectively test candidate methods for predicting turbine performance in outer range climatic conditions (using real world turbine performance data).</li>
<li>To define a set of generic (technology agnostic) best practice guidelines.</li>
<li>To objectively quantify the uncertainties associated with the application of the best practice methods.</li>
<li>To provide a framework for stakeholders to improve upon the generic guidelines using technology specific datasets.</li>
<li>To publically disseminate all conclusions and recommendations to all relevant stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
The above objectives will achieve key elements of the <a href="roadmaps/PCWG-2018-Roadmap.pdf" target="_blank">PCWG 2018 Roadmap</a>.
