<h2>Power Curve Working Group</h2>
<p>During the <a title="Analysis of Operating Wind Farms 2012" target="_blank" href="http://www.ewea.org/events/workshops/past-workshops/analysis-of-operating-wind-farms/">EWEA workshop on the Analysis of Operating Wind Farms (2012)</a> it became clear that the impact of 'non-standard' (now commonly called 'Outer-Range') inflow conditions on wind turbine power curves is a key issue facing the wind industry today.</p>
<p>A follow up activity of the workshop was the formation of a working group on the impact of Outer Range inflow conditions on power curves. The Power Curve Working Group (PCWG) aims to facilitate stakeholder collaboration in order to acknowledge, address and ultimately resolve this question.</p>
<p>The PCWG is now in its fifth year and has a membership of over 350 people drawn from over 140 organisations. The PCWG continues its core mission : <b><i>to bring together wind industry stakeholders to help identify and develop ways to improve the modelling of turbine performance in real world wind conditions.</i></b></p>

<h2>How to join the PCWG</h2>

<h2>Intelligence Sharing Initiative</h2>
<p>
The goals of the PCWG Intelligence Sharing Initiative (PCWG-Share-X) are as follows:
<ul>
<li>To objectively test candidate methods for predicting turbine performance in outer range climatic conditions (using real world turbine performance data).</li>
<li>To define a set of generic (technology agnostic) best practice guidelines.</li>
<li>To objectively quantify the uncertainties associated with the application of the best practice methods.</li>
<li>To provide a framework for stakeholders to improve upon the generic guidelines using technology specific datasets.</li>
<li>To publically disseminate all conclusions and recommendations to all relevant stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
The above objectives will achieve key elements of the <a href="roadmaps/PCWG-2016-Roadmap.pdf" target="_blank">PCWG Roadmap</a>.

<li>For details of concepts behind PCWG-Share-X see: <a href="PCWG-Share-01\PCWG-Share-01-Definition-Document.pdf" target="_blank">PCWG-Share-01 Definition Document</a>.</li>
